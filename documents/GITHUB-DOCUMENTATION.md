# GitHub Documentation
This document informs the developer and the project members how to use the GitHub Project planner.
The planner can be found here: [GitHub Project Planner](https://github.com/orgs/kth-ii1302-vt22-group-3/projects/4/views/2).

## Workflow

### Individual Workflow during sprint
1. Go to [Current sprint table](https://github.com/orgs/kth-ii1302-vt22-group-3/projects/4/views/6).
2. Look at the **Sprint backlog** category.
3. Find a task that you want to work on and move it to the **Checked out** column.
4. Assign yourself to the task in the [Current sprint list](https://github.com/orgs/kth-ii1302-vt22-group-3/projects/4/views/5).
5. When you have completed the task, move it to the **Test** column, waiting for completion test.
6. When the test has been passed the task can be moved to **Done** column.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 until all tasks related to a story has been moved to the **Done** column.

### Group Workflow
Adding a story:
1. Go to [Project Planner List](https://github.com/orgs/kth-ii1302-vt22-group-3/projects/4/views/2).
2. Add stories under **Product Backlog**.
3. Add a story.
   1. Go to [Stories Table](https://github.com/orgs/kth-ii1302-vt22-group-3/projects/4/views/5).
   2. Click on the plus sign on the top right at the last column, which will add a new column that can enter the Story name.
   3. Go back to **Project Planner List**.
   4. Add the newly-created story. (This is for referencing tasks to the story)
4. Add points. (Optional)
5. Add total hours. (Optional)

During the Sprint planning meeting stories are moved the current sprint. When a story has been moved to a sprint, add the assosciated tasks:

2. Click on the plus sign "Add item" to add the task in the current sprint (lowercase letters for tasks).
3. In the Story column, select the story to which the task is assosciated.
4. Redo steps 1-3 until all required tasks are created for the story.
